# [Discord] Music Bot

## Project Scope
DJ PaixHug is the initial name for the music bot and the main idea is to have a bot playing playlists without disconnecting. There are a few number of free bots with these option and no ads and that was the motivation to start the project.
The bot is still under development. It is being built in Python and oriented to Discord.

**Prefix:** %

**Current commands available:**
- info/inf: Board with details of the bot
- hello/hi: Greetings to the user
- ping: Sends a message to verify if bot is up/available
- join: Bot joins current user's voice channel
- leave: Bot disconnects from current channel

**MH commands being developed:**
- play *Playlist_link*: Bot plays Youtube Playlist
- Cloud integration will be required in order to have a 24/7 bot consistently playing

**WH commands:**
- play works for spotify playlists
- sql folder is already created for a possible integration in the future. It is important to refer that this is very low priority since it is not inside the project scope.
